PhD candidate in the [AIME lab](https://ailab.bio/research-themes) ðŸ§¬, I combine a keen interest in AI-driven molecular engineering with practical experience in high performance computing ðŸš€. My research centers on applying AI to predict [protein degradation](https://github.com/ribesstefano/PROTAC-Degradation-Predictor) and [optimize molecular design](https://github.com/ribesstefano/PROTAC-Splitter). I have developed and deployed algorithms on [GPU](https://github.com/ribesstefano/GPU-accelerated-Finite-Element-Method-using-Python-and-CUDA) and [FPGA](https://github.com/ribesstefano/Mapping-Multiple-LSTM-Models-on-FPGAs) platforms, enabling efficient computational simulations and model compression. I am eager to continue advancing the interface between computation and biochemistry. Discover more about my work on my personal [webpage](https://ribesstefano.github.io) ðŸ”—.
