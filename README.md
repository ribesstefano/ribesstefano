PhD candidate in the [AIME lab](https://ailab.bio/research-themes) 🧬, I combine a keen interest in AI-driven molecular engineering with practical experience in high performance computing 🚀. My research centers on applying machine learning to predict protein degradation and optimize molecular design. I have developed and deployed algorithms on GPU and FPGA platforms, enabling efficient computational simulations and model compression. I am eager to continue advancing the interface between computation and biochemistry. Discover more about my work on my personal [webpage](https://ribesstefano.github.io) 🔗.
